#collection = single "variable" used to store multiple values
# List = [] ordered and changable, duplicates okay
#Set = {} unordered and immutable,no duplicates, add/remove okay
# Tuple = () ordered and unchangable dupliicates ok, faster

fruits = ["apple", "orange", "banana", "coconut"]

#print(fruits[::3])

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
